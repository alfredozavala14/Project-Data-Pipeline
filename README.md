# Project-Data-Pipeline

## Introduction

This is the second weekly project in the Ironhack Data Analytics bootcamp. The objective is to practice the class learnings so far. This includes, cleaning a dataset, enriching it with data from an API and/or web scraping, and creating a report with statistics and plots.

To do this, we can use a dataset of our choice. I have decided to use a dataset with information on the happiness across 156 countries. This dataset can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ayushggarg/all-trumps-twitter-insults-20152021)
